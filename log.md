# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: Saturday, September 1

**Today's Progress**: I went through the first chapter of the Bash Guide.

**Thoughts**: I chose to start with bash because it's one of the first tools I used when I did my bootcamp and yet it's still a mystery. I got very complacent with my discomfort with it so I'm trying to change that.

## Day 2: Sunday, September 2

**Today's Progress**: I went through the first half of chapter 2 of the Bash Guide.

**Thoughts**: I never really thought about how commands work in bash, and the different parts of a command. Now I know the names of the different parts of a command!

## Day 3: Monday, September 3

**Today's Progress**: I finished chapter 2 of the Bash Guide.

**Thoughts**: Whew, commands are a lot more involved than I realized. I learned about writing file directions outputs to a file, and how to send multiple streams to the same file.
